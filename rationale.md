# Purpose

ETC.A is a community-owned public/open source/what have you Instruction Set Architecture. It is developed by the community of the Turing Complete game. We have a few goals:
1) [bare-metal] Being designed for the purpose of having a well-standardized architecture for use in community programming challenges.
2) [approachable] In the most restricted form, be simple enough that newcomers can get involved easily.
3) [extensible] Flexible enough to be extensible (The name, ETC.A, stands for "extensible turing complete architecture"). Code assembled for a hardware with some set of extensions should run on _any_ hardware with a superset of those extensions.
4) [educational] Be interesting, allowing for features and hardware implementations that have educational value.
5) [practicality] Be practical; if in 30 years someone wants to build and use a machine for the ISA, that should be not only reasonable but natural.
6) [common cases] The most common cases of instructions should have a shorter encoding, if possible.

# Individual Decisions

Here we will record some individual decisions and why we made the choices we did. Please don't re-hash a discussion we've already had without bringing a new perspective.

### Lots of Reserved Space in the base ISA

The goal with the base ISA is to be simple enough to build, relatively complete, while also functioning as a compact representation for the most common cases of instructions.
Less common cases can be emulated with the compact instructions, but will have a less compact representation offered by extensions as well.

The most common cases of many types of instructions cannot arise in the base ISA. One of the most common instructions in typical x86 assembly is `call`, which the base ISA
does not even have. Most (but not all) of the reserved space is reserved for such common instructions which do not make sense in the base ISA. The bits labeled `SS` are reserved
as _size bits_, allowing an instruction to have an operational width of 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes. One of the bits near the jump format is reserved for turning jumps into
calls, while another is for indirect jumps. We are not yet sure what we want to use the two LSBs of the operand byte for, but some ideas include a mode switch similar to
x86's `MOD R/M` byte.

The most significant bits of the opcode byte being `11` are reserved for any extensions to use as is relevant to them.

### Only Relative Jumps

Relative jumps are as complete as absolute jumps. The "common cases" of conditional jump instructions are for control flow within a single function.
Such jumps are usually a short distance compared to absolute jumps or calls. With absolute jumps, a jump instruction near the start or end of a "code page boundary"
(least significant byte all 0s, for the base ISA) cannot jump to instructions in the adjacent page. Relative jumps can.

### What the heck is `slo`?

This instruction is "shift-left 5 bits, then OR." Since the base ISA only has 5-bit immediate formats, it is very difficult to build larger constant values with typical operations.
The `slo` operation can be used to build any 16-bit immediate in at most 4 instructions, and most in 3. The first one or two instructions are from the following lines:
```
[mov r,imm[14:10]]                      if bit 15 is the same as bit 14 (this will cause sign extension)
[movz r,imm[14:10]]                     if bit 15 is zero and bit 14 is one
[mov r,imm[15]]; [slo r,imm[14:10]]     if bit 15 is one and bit 14 is zero
```
This puts the top 6 bits in `r[5:0]`. The remainder of the construction is `slo r,imm[9:5]; slo r,imm[4:0]`.

### C and O flags: undefined after logic

The spec dictates that the value of the C and O flags is implementation-dependent after a bitwise logical operation. It may seem like a good idea to instead mandate that they
keep their old values. The original microprocessors (such as the Intel 8008/8008-1) did actually work this way. It was determined to be confusing. Additionally, it is more
useful for such operations to provide an easy way to clear the C flag.

There is another very important reason for not keeping the old values. Very advanced processors, called _superscalar processors_, are capable of executing instructions in
a different order than they appear in the program binary, as long as the behavior of the program is unchanged. If flags could keep their own values even through instructions
that modify the flags, then the dependency chain of instructions referring to the flags (called "data hazards") becomes very complicated and hard to track, preventing
out-of-order execution on some cases where it should be possible.

### Opcode Placement

Opcodes are still moving around as people build and experiment with the ISA. We try to place opcodes so that decoding is as simple as possible. We are aware of at least 2 
functional decoders as of 2/28/2022 which do not match _any_ complete opcodes. Opcodes are to be arranged so that particular control signals can be detected from particular bits
with very little circuitry. For example, the pattern `01xxxxxx` can be recognized to enable a control line that switches the B operand from a register to an immediate.
The pattern `0xxxxxCC` with `CC â‰  11` enables storing the result in a register.

Such patterns may be broken by future extensions, but the base ISA is to be as approachable as possible.

### Undefined Behavior if Jumping to RAM

Any useful "practical" general-purpose processor must support executing programs out of RAM. An OS needs to be able to copy a program from main memory to RAM, mark
it as executable, and then execute it.

However, getting this right is difficult for newcomers. The possibility of an instruction reading from its own address means that memory contention is already
possible in the base ISA. For many people coming from the Turing Complete game, such memory conention is a completely new challenge. As such, the base ISA only specifies
undefined behavior in these cases. The intent is that such machines will treat their whole address space as available RAM while reading instructions from separate memory.
This is also a useful anti-specification for a future in embedded devices. Embedded devices are frequently tiny and can be more easily built if the program is known,
stored in a ROM, and divided from data memory. By not requiring executable RAM, we ensure that programs can be compatible across a wider range of spec-compliant
bare metal devices.

Of course, an extension will indicate that the processor supports executable RAM.

### Placement of Extensions

The selection of which extensions are put into the first 4 bits of `CPUID1` and `CPUID2` is done with the thought that these are commonly (but not always) used and implemented extensions, that if not present are for many programs complete deal-breakers, i.e. they can't work if those are missing. They are assigned to the first 4 bits because those are easy to check for/enable when only base-isa is available, using code similar to this.

```asm
          mov  %r0, cpuid1
          and  %r0, 0xF
          cmp  %r0, 0xF     ; are the core extensions available?
          jne  fail
          mov  %r0, cpuid2
          and  %r0, 0xF
          cmp  %r0, 0xF     ; are the core extensions available?
          jeq  can_work
fail:
          hlt               ; halt and catch fire
can_work: ... ; rest of the program (including interupt setup)
```
These eight extensions together make up `etca.f.f.0` or the "core extensions".
