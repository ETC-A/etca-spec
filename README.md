# ETC.A
Extensible Turing Complete Architecture

This repo is for designing an ISA that has a simple core and a lot of extensions that can be added ontop.
It's primary goal is to be build in the game [Turing Complete](https://turingcomplete.game) and to be easy to implement in there.

An extensible assembler built for this arch is [here](https://github.com/MegaIng/etca-asm)
