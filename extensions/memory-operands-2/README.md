# General design

**Extension State: Under Development**  
**Requires: Base, VWI**  
**CPUID Bit: CP1.13**

# Overview

This extension adds additional memory operand modes, which are independent from those described by [MO1](../memory-operands-1/README.md).
Familiarity with MO1 is encouraged for reading this document. However, MO1 and MO2 are independent. MO2 does not require MO1.
Familiarity with the full-immediates extension is encouraged likewise.

# Added Instruction Formats

These instruction formats apply to any instruction which encodes operands using an `ABM` byte _unless_ that instruction already performs a memory
read or write in which case it is _unspecified_ behavior.

| `ABM` | Followed By 1 | Followed By 2 | Followed By 3 |Specified First Operand | Specified Second Operand |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-----------|--|--|
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 001 \| 000 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `i8` | `[dP]` | `i8`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 010 \| 000 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `i8` | | `[SIB.B]` | `i8`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 011 \| 000 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `i8` | `[SIB.B + dP]` | `i8`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 101 \| 000 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `i8` | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + dP]` | `i8`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 110 \| 000 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `i8` | | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + SIB.B]` | `i8`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 111 \| 000 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `i8` | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + SIB.B + dP]` | `i8`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 001 \| 001 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `iS` | `[dP]` | `iS`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 010 \| 001 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `iS` | | `[SIB.B]` | `iS`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 011 \| 001 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `iS` | `[SIB.B + dP]` | `iS`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 101 \| 001 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `iS` | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + dP]` | `iS`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 110 \| 001 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `iS` | | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + SIB.B]` | `iS`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| 111 \| 001 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` | `iS` | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + SIB.B + dP]` | `iS`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| AAA \| 100 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `d8` |      | `A` | `[ip + d8]`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| AAA \| 101 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | `dP` |      | `A` | `[ip + dP]`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| AAA \| 110 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | | | `A` | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + SIB.B]`
|<pre>+-----+-----+----+<br>\| AAA \| 111 \| 01 \|<br>+-----+-----+----+</pre> | `SIB` | | | `[2^SIB.S * SIB.X + SIB.B]` | `A`

The value `ip` is the address in memory of the current instruction.

## `REX.Q`

A `REX.Q` prefix can be used with instructions in this format if:
  - The instruction has _exactly one_ of a displacement or immediate. It cannot have both.
  - either:
    - The instruction is an `iS` mode with Operand Size attribute `quad`
    - The instruction is a `dP` mode and the current Addressing Mode is `quad`
  - The [register expansion](../expanded-registers/README.md) extension is available

Then the `iS` or `dP` will be an 8-byte value rather than a 4-byte value.

The behavior when `REX.Q` is set while in `quad` addressing mode when _any_ of the following conditions is true is reserved and _must_ cause an illegal instruction exception unless explicitly relaxed by another extension or feature.
  - The instruction has an `iS` and a `dP`
  - The instruction has an `iS` and a `d8`
  - The instruction has an `i8` and a `dP`

# Added Instruction

| Name | Encoding | Operands | Description |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| LEA r, m | `00SS1110` | `ABM` | Loads the address specified by the second operand into the register specified by the first. Note that the address _itself_ is stored in the register, not the contents of memory at that address. The result stored in the register must respect the operand size attribute. The computed address must respect the address mode.

`LEA` means "load effective address." If the first operand is not a register, or the second is not a memory location, the instruction must be treated as an
_illegal_ instruction. Note that as per the
[Full Immediates extension](../full-immediates/README.md) in the specific case of `MM=01, ABM.regB=01x`
(the "full immediate" operand modes) this opcode corresponds to `READCR`, not `LEA`. Similarly, the specific case of `MM=01, ABM.regB=00x` also refers to `READCR` and `WRITECR` instead of `LEA` and `POP`.

Note that LEA shares an opcode with `READCR` (aka `mfcr`). `LEA` has no immediate mode, and `READCR` has
no register-to-register mode.

`LEA` does not affect any CPU flags. In addition to its stated purpose, it can be used to perform some "complex" arithmetic such as
copy-and-add operations, in a single instruction and without affecting flags. For example, `LEA` can be used to
encode `rx2 ‚Üê r0 + 4 * r1 + 10` in one 4-byte instruction, as `1E 5A 88 0A`.

This same specification of `LEA` is described in [memory-operands-1](../memory-operands-1/README.md), but these extensions
are independent and can each coexist without the other. It is generally recommend, however, that a system supporting
MO2 also support MO1.

# AOE Table

The added instructions can be seen in the complete Advanced Operand Extensions table, which encompasses the FI, MO1, and MO2 extensions. They are under `Mode=01`, `ABM != 01x`.
